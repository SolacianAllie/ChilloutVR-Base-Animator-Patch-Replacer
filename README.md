# ChilloutVR-Base-Animator-Patch-Replacer
This is a replacement/patch for the default animator included in ChilloutVR's CCK.  It should be imported after the CCK and allows for custom locomotion animations, as well as a system for adding custom emotes.  This patch will be regularly updated to stay compatible with future CCK versions.
