# ChilloutVR-Base-Animator-Patch-Replacer
This is a replacement/patch for the default animator included in ChilloutVR's CCK.  It should be imported after the CCK and allows for custom locomotion animations, as well as a system for adding custom emotes.  This patch will be regularly updated to stay compatible with future CCK versions.

The animations provided by default in this animator replacer were obtained via NotAKids outdated ChillouVR animator patch.
